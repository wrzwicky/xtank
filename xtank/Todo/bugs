message menu not reset when vehicle dies even though message type is reset

in robot mode, the names given by the commentator lack the playername

other player hitting q when 1st player is in menu mode crashes xtank

I had a hexo who got stuck on the intersection between two right-
angled walls. 

When loading a program, if there is already a default,
(/mit/games/src/vax/xtank/Programs/Blazee.o) sometimes the name is long enough
that when you type in the name of a second program
(/mit/games/src/vax/xtank/Programs/Blaga.o) will dissapear off the edge of the
screen as you type.

Funny, a buddy-tank just went right through one of the walls--not two
connected walls, one wall.  The ball went through the corner, and he
got it and proceeded to try throwing it at his teammate (signs of
intelligence?).  Now I have 6 buddies trying to break through the
walls, and one somewhere out there with the disc (he lost it).

However, Terry, I saw one of the buddies slip between the walls.  
Need explaining?  ok, the walls are like this:

		|
		|

continuous, of course.  Anyway, he just ran into the wall and popped
out the other side.  THIS WAS NOT A CORNER.  Any solutions to this
problem yet?



Check for duplicate terminals or the lack of a terminal in combatants list

make terminal status reset at the beginning of each game
