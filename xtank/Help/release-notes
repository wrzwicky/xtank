              Release Notes for the Xtank UMDENG 1.3e Release

New features:

   * entirely new console driver

   * support for SVR4 style threading
     It was working on the SVR4 machines we had before we had to
     give them back to the vendor.  We'd like to hear about any
     success stories that people have with this code.

   * partial cleanup of THREAD_MP code
     (It's only a little cleaner.  Most likely it will get majorly
     whacked in the next release.)

   * no more support for the old .v vehicle file formats
     We told you it was going away, *poof*, now it's gone.
     Convert any vehicles you can't live without, and mail
     the .V files to xtank-request@eng.umd.edu for possible
     inclusion in the next release.

     Actaully, it does support them.  We can guarentee that it will
     not support them in the next release.

   * two new submitted vehicle bodies.
     They can accelerate really fast, but have space and weight
     limitations that don't let them unbalance the game.

Known Problems:
   * no updates to the programmer docs (UTSL)
   * bugs exist -- feel free to send patchs
   * still no real prototypes, except for lowlib calls
