To build this UMDENG Xtank distribution:

         1) "chmod +w Imakefile.Config"
         2) Edit Imakefile.Config for your site
         3) "xmkmf"
         4) "make Makefiles"
         5) "make"
         6) Edit the xtank shell script in Bin/xtank so it knows
            where you put the xtank binaries.
