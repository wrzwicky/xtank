Makefile	makefile for programs resident here

mazedesc.c
dmaz.c		program for printing out mazes in ascii.

ovjview.c	Source files for a programs used to manipulate .obj files
objcon.c	(collections of bitmaps in Src/Objects directory)

x10tox11.c
x11tox10.c	bitmap conversion programs (rather obsolete, I think)

r16.c
r1to3.c
r4.c		Old bitmap rotators (very poorly written, no filtering).
