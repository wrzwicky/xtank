To build this UMDENG Xtank distribution:

         0) Make sure that you system has "imake" installed on it.
            If your computer vendor was stupid enough to ship X11R?,
            and not ship "imake" with it, we don't want to know about
            it.  Tell your vendor to fix this brain damage, quickly.
         1) "chmod +w Imakefile.Config"
         2) Edit Imakefile.Config for your site
         3) "xmkmf"
         4) "make Makefiles"
         5) "make"
         6) Edit the xtank shell script in Bin/xtank so it knows
            where you put the xtank binaries.

Note: If you do not have have "flex" installed on your system, you will
need to copy some files around before you can build things.  Namely,
you should copy .../Src/vload.flexed to .../Src/vload.c and
copy .../Src/setups.flexed to .../Src/setups.c

Keep the original .flexed files around, in case something bad happens...
