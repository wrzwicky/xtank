UMD-ENG Hacks (partial list):
----------------------------
    Screenery
    =========
        Shocker Walls   - Electrified walls really hurt.  Scalable (0-10).
        Peace           - Bullets ting while on YOUR peace square.

    Treads
    ======
        Hover           - Experimental.

    Specials
    ========
        Repair          - Costs ALOT, when stopped, swaps fuel for armor.
        RamPlate        - When you hit someone with your FRONT, 
                          you cause extra damage and take less.
                          The RamPlate weighs half that of your front armor.
        Navigation      - Makes driving backwards much easier.  You
                          head toward the direction you choose,
                          rather than away from it.

    Misc
    ====
        Scrolling menus - Kinda obvious
        Xdefaults       - Documented elsewhere
