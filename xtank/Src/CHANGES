Changes for version 1.2 released 24Nov89

Thanks to Christopher North-Keys, Robert Potter, Bill Bolosky,
Tor Lillqvist, and Juha Sarlin for their improvements.

Moved #include's for dynamic loading into the DYNALOAD #ifdef.

Added #ifndef's to avoid compiler warnings in Xlibint.h

Added check for LOGNAME env variable for username in file.c (used on hp's)

Added to Makefile entries for HP9000 series 800, sunlwp, and TAGS
Cleaned up some unused entries too.

Moved replacement #define for drem from hit.c and lowlib.c into sysdep.h.
Added hpux to list of those using replacement atan2() and drem().

Added setjmp and stack pointer assignment code for hp9000s800 to thread.[ch]

Switched from using void * to using char * in thread.c.

Added hp9k8 dynamic loading code to unix.c.  Also cleaned up the network
checking code, converting strcpy's to bcopy's, since nulls might exist
in the 4 byte addresses.

Added #ifdef X11R2FONTS around X11R2 fontnames in x11.c

Added warning message for when screen is too small for parent window in x11.c

Added flush_cache_hp9k8.s file used by HP dynamic loading in unix.c

Now malloc executable_name in main.c, instead of limiting length to 40

Added spaces for #define DEBUG and #define X11R2FONTS in config.h

Increased buffer sizes for filenames and pathnames in file.c and interface.c
Changed the environment variables for pathnames to XTANK_DIR, XTANK_VEHICLES,
XTANK_MAZES, and XTANK_PROGRAMS, a trailing "/" is no longer required.

Ensured that Terminal structure is initialized to zero in gr.c

Implemented real timer to control real game speed in icounter.c and actions.c

Set initial game speed to 15 frames/sec in init.c

Added Sun LWP implementation of threads package to threads.[ch] and config.h

Bug fixes to warrior.c to avoid hanging/crashing.

Fixed null pointer dereferences in cosell.c and file.c

Initialized all.last_angle in warrior_main() of warrior.c

Added a cd into the programs directory before compiling in unix.c

Bumped version number up to 1.2 in xtank.h

Changes for version 1.1 released 02Nov1989

Thanks to Christos Zoulas, Steve Jankowski, and Hal Peterson, for their
improvements

Rewrote thread package in a much simpler and readable form.  Now resides
in thread.c and thread.h.

Increased robot program stack size from 20K to 25K in program.h

Added #define THREAD   in config.h for enabling threading code.
Added #define DYNALOAD in config.h for enabling dynamic loading code.
Added #define CHECKNET in config.h for enabling network address check code.
Added #define XTANKDIR in config.h for setting the default pathname.

Added spot for #define SUNOS4_0 or SUNOS3_0 in config.h so that
the thread code will use the right location in jmp_buf for the stack
pointer.

Fixed up Makefile.  This will still require changes for different
machine types.  I know of no machine-independent way of determining
the machine type in the makefile.

Created macro for atan2, called ATAN2 in sysdep.h which avoids
calling atan2 with x==0 && y==0.  Replaced calls to atan2 with ATAN2
in box.c, drone.c, hit.c, input.c, lowlib.c, update.c, and warrior.c.

Removed NULL pointer dereferencing in file.c, collision.c, and interface.c.

In main.c moved initialization of eset and bset into main().

Bumped version number up to 1.1 in xtank.h
