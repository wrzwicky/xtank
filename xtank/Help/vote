So, just what is Xtank?

Briefly put, Xtank is a multi-player vehicular-based (normally
combat-oriented) game played in mazes of various sizes and types.
Humans control a vehicle (usually a tank) equipped with a variety of
armor and weaponry.  Your objective depends on the type of game you
play.  (Combat, War, Ultimate, Capture the flag, or Race).  Xtank
runs under X11R[345], on a variety of hardware platforms:  Sun3,
Sun4, RS6000, IBM PC/RT, Vaxes, DECstations, Silicon Graphics,
Motorola SysV boxes, Encore Multimaxes (Sys 5 universe).  (Not all
features are supported on all platforms.)  One of the more unique
features about xtank is that it is a multi-threaded game.  This
allows players to load a robot program file (either written in "C" or
a "C" linkable language) into the running Xtank image and start
playing with that program.  Thus, each player can "submit" a program
that can control a vehicle for the duration of a game.
