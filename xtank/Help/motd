UMD-ENG Hacks (partial list):
    Screenery
        Shocker Walls   - Electrified walls really hurt.  Scalable (0-10).
        Peace           - Bullets ting while on YOUR peace square.
    Treads
        Hover           - Experimental.
    Specials
        Repair          - Costs ALOT, when not moving, swaps fuel for armor.
        RamPlate        - When you hit someone with your FRONT, 
                          you cause extra damage and take less.
                          The RamPlate weighs half that of your front armor.
        Navigation      - Makes driving backwards much easier.  You
                          head toward the direction you choose,
                          rather than away from it.
    Misc
