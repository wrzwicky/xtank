Bugs noticed but _not_ fixed:

        peace symbol used in maze design is inverted

        when escher_width is 0, junk gets left on screen

        MAX_WEAPONS and VMAX_WEAPONS should swap names.  This would probably
        introduce hard-to-find bugs, tho.

        We should just clean out the vehicles directory and start from scratch.
        Way too much cruft there.

        Somebody should go through /Help and bring it up to date.
