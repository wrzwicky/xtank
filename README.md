# xtank
Original sources for the old "xtank" game. I found these on the Internet, and thought I'd assemble them here for reference, forking, etc. Note that this is a Linux game, so file names are case-sensitive, at least in the early versions. Note also there are two head versions (1.4d and north-0.2); I don't know which is best, so if you do anything with this repo, you may want to merge those branches.
