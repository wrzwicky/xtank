Beta test notes.

We need you to:
  * Tell us what your set-up is (Hardware, OS, config.h).
  * Tell us if it works.
  * Tell us if it doesn't work.
  * Tell us if it doesn't work, and you know why it doesn't
  * Tell us if it almost works.
  * Tell us if you like it.
  * Tell us if you don't like it.
  * Tell us if it improves your sex life.

The "us" is skeeve@eng.umd.edu and stripes@eng.umd.edu.  Or if you like
"xtank@eng.umd.edu".  To be added to the "xtank@eng.umd.edu" list send
the above info to xtank-request@eng.umd.edu along with a request to be
added to the list.

Our set-up: sun3's & sun4's SUN_LWP.

By the way, 1.2 used machtype or it's ilk to figure out if it was a VAX or
a Sun, or whatever.  Since we don't have that, but do have arch, and arch
is standard in SunOS and BSD4.4 we use it.  If you don't have one, just
make a shell script that echos the machene type.
