This is the main source directory for Xtank.  Subdirectories include:

Fixed		fixed point arithmetic library, not currently used.
Objects		Files describing all pictures in the game

Files of interest:

XMultiSync.c	Implementation of parallel XSync call to multiple terminals
bugs		list of numerous bugs and suggested improvements (some done)
config.h	Place to configure the game to your machine
sysdep.h	any system dependent #defines go here
thread.c	multi-threading package
CHANGES		Changes made to code since first release on expo

Currently runs on:

IBM RT
DEC VAX
Sun (SunOS 3.5, 4.0.1, 4.0.3, on Sun-3 and Sun-4, most likely...)
HP9000 series 800

Thanks to Steve Jankowski, Christos S. Zoulas, Hal Peterson,
Christopher North-Keys, Robert Potter, Bill Bolosky, and Tor
Lillqvist for their improvements. 

To compile for one of the machines above, goto config.h and do what it says.


Desired improvements:

1.  Get it running on other hardware.  (HP9000 series 300, Apollo, Dec 3100's)

This requires porting the multi-threading code, which is used to run
multiple robot programs concurrently to control the enemy vehicles in
the game.  For most machines, this requires a change to thread.c
around line 58, where the stack pointer register is initialized.
Or you can substitute a different threads package if one is available
on your machine.

This also requires porting the dynamic linking code, which is
used to load object code for robot programs into the running
executable.  The current implementation in unix.c should work on most
Unixes.  Never strip an xtank executable since that makes it
impossible to dynamically link.  If you can't get the dynamic linking
code working, just remove the #define DYNALOAD in config.h.
You will then not be able to add new robot programs without recompiling.

If you are not running X11R3, you may have to modify the graphics code. 
All the X specific code is in x11.c.  Scattered about the
code you will find #ifdef AMIGA and #ifdef 640x200.  They don't work.
Neither does the Amiga version.

2.  Make multi-player games easier to start.  This can be done by
having xtank listen to some port (or a zephyr message class for
those who have it) for messages from other machines that want to join
the game.  Also, when someone starts a game of xtank, xtank would
call out to the network (on the known port) to find out if there
are any other machines currently running xtank.  If so, the player
would be asked if he wants to join that game (perhaps with some
information about the number of people currently playing, what game,
etc.).  The player should also have the option of not allowing
other players join the game, if he just wants to play alone.

3.  More conformance to X application standards (support for more
XResources, a man page, correct command line option handling).
Perhaps use of a toolkit (although I don't like the thought of the
executable doubling in size...).  

4.  A better language for writing robot programs (along with a fast
interpreter/compiler for the language).  This seems like a big
project to me, but I know many programmers who are better at writing
compilers than me!

5.  Better color support.  Currently I'm not sure if it even works
correctly on a color machine...

6.  More dynamic listings of vehicles and mazes that are available.
I'd really like to see a list of all the mazes in the Mazes directory
and browse through them quickly.

7.  Difficulty levels (currently the difficulty level does very
little).  This is pretty easy to do, since you just need to pick
a set of vehicles and robot programs from the set available.  To
facilitate this, it may be useful to write robot programs which
look at the difficulty level of the game to decide how well to play.

8. Implementing new games.  Let your imagination run wild.  Xtank was
designed to maximize player creativity.

For more suggestions, see the Todo directory.

If you do make any worthwhile change, send me some context
diffs, or the new source files so everyone can take advantage of it.
If you design any killer mazes, be sure to send them along too.

I heartily recommend 2-on-2 Ultimate with commentator and no-wear set,
2-on-2, in moosemaze with everyone in Ultimate vehicles.  It has the
pace and feel of ice hockey.
