The latest Xtank beta release is available via anonymous FTP on the
hosts azathoth.sura.net and on ftp.eng.umd.edu, in the directory /pub/xtank.

Be sure to read the builtin Release Notes.  Also, you should
probably check out the FAQ answers that have been included.

Please *NOTE* -- this is an beta quality release, as opposed
to the last alpha quality release.  As such, we know
there are bugs, and so forth, but feel that it is important
to get this code out to people for them to play with it.
