# xtank
Original sources for the old "xtank" game. I found these on the Internet, and thought I'd assemble them here for reference, forking, etc. Note that this is a Linux game, so file names are case-sensitive, at least in the early versions.

Important Branches and Tags:
* Branch '**master**' will get you 1.4d plus this README.
* Tag '**1.4d**' gets you version 1.4d, as it was released so long ago. Likewise for the other tags.
* Tag '**xtank-north-0.2**' gets you sources for a version that was packaged up for Debian. Found at [quozl.linux.org.au](https://quozl.linux.org.au/xtank). Appears to be branched off of 1.3f, which is where I put it.

I don't know the history or quality of any of this source, I'm just putting it here for historical purposes.

If you do anything with this repo, I'd recommend you check out 'master', then try to merge xtank-north-0.2 to create the One True Repo, then post that somewhere so we have it. Then you can work from there.
